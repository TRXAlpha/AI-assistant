# üß† Context-Aware AI Assistant Overview

A self-hosted, modular, context-aware AI assistant designed to run entirely under local control. It integrates software, hardware, and embedded firmware systems to assist with automation, real-time environmental sensing, and digital hygiene enforcement.

The assistant runs primarily on a mobile workstation with task offloading to a dedicated compute node over Ethernet. Interaction occurs through multiple endpoints: desktop notifications, Telegram bot commands, a local REST API, and a Pico WH-based OLED dashboard. Control logic is distributed across a network of RISC-V and Xtensa-based microcontrollers running custom firmware.

## üß† Core Systems

### Context Management

**Real-Time Mode Detection**
The assistant monitors active window titles, focused processes, CPU/RAM loads, input activity, and foreground applications to infer modes such as coding, idle, media, gaming, meeting, or presenting.

**Mode History Logging**
Each mode transition is recorded in timestamped JSON files (`mode_YYYY-MM-DD.json`) with contextual metadata such as app focus history, duration, and environmental state.

**Nighttime Summarization Routine**
At 23:59, the assistant executes a consolidation pipeline that:

* Merges mode history with system metrics (CPU/RAM peaks, active time).
* Analyzes and embeds Hackatime coding session data.
* Gathers all notes and user interactions from the past day.
* Packages results into Markdown or JSON digests for archival and model finetuning.

## üîê Cybersecurity Enforcement & Media Gating

### Conditional Media Access

**Social Media Challenge Gate**
Upon detection of non-productive applications such as TikTok or Instagram (via active window title, binary hash, or known process names), access is conditionally gated behind a real-time security knowledge prompt. Example logic:

```json
{
  "app": "tiktok.exe",
  "detected_at": "17:02",
  "challenge": {
    "type": "cybersec_question",
    "prompt": "Describe how a buffer overflow works and how it could be exploited.",
    "success_threshold": 0.85
  }
}
```

Correct answers allow temporary access; incorrect responses result in a soft lockout and visual alert via hardware modules.

**YouTube Content Classification**
A hybrid classifier combining video title, description, and real-time tab activity determines whether a video is educational. This is accomplished through a local model using logistic regression on:

* Keyword vectors
* Channel reputation (whitelist/blacklist)
* Content category (via unofficial YouTube API wrapper)

After 60 minutes of allowed educational content, any switch to entertainment videos triggers a redirect to a gamified platform (e.g., Robocode, Ruby Warrior) for reinforcement.

## üí° Local AI Foundation Model

### Model Strategy

The assistant uses **MythoMax 13B Q4\_L\_M** as its primary reasoning engine due to its:

* Fully modifiable architecture (compatible with custom finetunes, LoRA adapters)
* High compatibility with quantized formats (e.g., GPTQ)
* Multimodal extensibility

MythoMax is run via **Ollama**, optimized for GPU inference using a **T1200 mobile Quadro**, with containerized interfaces and queue-based job dispatchers.

### Training & Finetuning

Finetuning uses a dataset of real interaction logs, curated notes, and anonymized context switches. Preprocessing pipeline includes:

* Token-level masking of sensitive content
* Reward modeling simulation for reinforcement-style training
* Sequence-level chunking to preserve temporal flow across session history

**Future plans include:**

* Integration of context windows that scale beyond 4k tokens via sliding-window memory architectures
* Contrastive learning routines between personal vs. generic usage profiles to prioritize high-relevance suggestions

### Justification for Reuse

Rather than training a model from scratch, the assistant leverages open-source models like MythoMax due to:

* Hardware constraints (local operation under 16‚Äì32 GB RAM)
* Time-to-value considerations
* Full transparency and reproducibility of open weight initialization

## üì∂ ESP8266 Honeypot Firmware

The honeypot operates on fully custom firmware, not Arduino code. Arduino-based implementations, while rapid for prototyping, introduce significant overhead, inefficient memory management, and abstraction layers that reduce real-time control over hardware. This firmware is written from scratch in C, acting as a minimalist operating system for the ESP8266 ‚Äî handling scheduling, I/O, memory, and communication directly at the hardware level.

### Design Philosophy

**Firmware as the MCU's OS**
The firmware is engineered to behave like a lightweight OS for the microcontroller, handling core tasks such as:

* Event polling and task scheduling
* Memory and peripheral management
* Network packet parsing and routing
* Logging and power management routines

**No Arduino Core**
There is no use of Arduino libraries or runtime. The firmware directly configures the ESP8266's registers, interrupt vectors, and timers to avoid unnecessary abstraction. The system uses:

* Static allocation to prevent heap fragmentation
* Custom UART drivers
* Direct manipulation of Wi-Fi SDK APIs

### Features

**Transparent Access Point**

* Operates as an open Wi-Fi AP with limited internet access
* All DNS and HTTP requests are intercepted and logged
* Captive-portal-like flow implemented manually at the packet level

**Heuristic Traffic Analysis**

* DNS requests are filtered through a local rule engine
* Suspicious patterns (e.g., malware domains, repeated requests) trigger an alert
* Traffic logs are written in raw binary to microSD (append-only)

**System Health Routines**

* Custom watchdog timer
* Self-repair on SD corruption
* OTA update support with partition verification

**Security Events**

* Signature scanning for botnet activity (e.g., Mirai-like traffic)
* Built-in anomaly scoring module
* Alerts forwarded to a central node over ESP-NOW

Future firmware builds may move to a fully custom bootloader and RISC-V SoC with integrated crypto engines. The focus remains on full control, optimized runtime behavior, and absolute minimum overhead ‚Äî not just code, but firmware tailored for its precise function.

## üß† Nighttime Analysis Pipeline

Every night, the assistant enters a scheduled evaluation phase:

**Log Digest**

* Parses all mode logs, usage metrics, and notes
* Looks for anomalies (e.g., excessive CPU spikes, unsynced folders, system crashes)

**Learning Loop**

* Summarized logs are passed through MythoMax to fine-tune behavior policies (e.g., when to suppress notifications, adjust thresholds, or change flow priorities)

**Report Generation**

* Creates a human-readable summary for the dashboard + compressed archive of all data
* Stored to microSD, synced to a NAS or cloud mirror if available

**Future Additions**

* Sentiment detection in written notes and mode context to help tune long-term assistant behavior
* Comparison across days/weeks for attention shifts and usage patterns

---

## üß© Expansion Possibilities

**Modified RISC-V SoCs**

* Future modules may use RISC-V-based MCUs with instruction set customization
* Aim: tighter memory management, hardware crypto acceleration, and better deep sleep behavior
* Candidate chip: Allwinner D1s or custom low-power RV32 cores

**Smart Glasses**

* OLED microdisplay with BLE link to the Mother module
* Trigger headless prompts or receive ambient status (CPU load, pending alerts)

**Wrist Modules**

* Wearable ESP32-S3-based bands with haptic alerting
* BLE mesh fallback for ESP-NOW gaps

## üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity

### Threat Modeling & Surface Analysis

The AI assistant treats all inbound device communication as potentially untrusted. A simplified threat model includes:

* Local DNS spoofing or poisoning attempts (handled via Pi-hole + DNSSEC + logging to the assistant)
* Malicious rogue APs or device clones (especially relevant given the ESP-NOW communications)
* Exfiltration attempts via unexpected DNS lookups from apps or background tasks
* Social engineering through content (handled by the behavioral gating layer)
* Insider threats (unmonitored bypasses via known admin devices)
* Model poisoning attempts (e.g., feeding specific prompts that could bias future actions if learned via local LLM)
* Replay attacks or unverified ESP-NOW pings from spoofed MACs

The assistant continuously cross-checks behavior logs, device presence, and user activity patterns to flag anomalies.

### DNS Surveillance & Tunneling Detection

The assistant tracks and parses all DNS logs via Pi-hole and embedded Wireshark-compatible sensors (Pico W or ESP32s). Each night, logs are parsed to:

* Detect DNS tunneling by tracking:

  * Unusually long TXT or NULL queries
  * Burst DNS queries to uncommonly used TLDs
* Identify domains with entropy above a threshold (possible DGA)
* Score domains against known CTI feeds (VirusTotal, if available)

Future plans include integrating a basic anomaly model that scores DNS patterns by device context.

### Firmware Hardening & OTA Logic

The ESP32-based assistant uses:

* MAC whitelist checks per-ping
* Rolling challenge-responses (nonces + HMAC derived via SHA256) for high-trust pings
* No default OTA; updates require USB flashing via pogo or a station module

Plans to implement ESP32 Secure Boot and Flash Encryption, with per-device keys stored on the host.

### Log Protection & Tamper-Evidence

All device logs are appended to encrypted rotating buffers. At the end of each day:

* A SHA256 hash is computed and stored on a hardened ESP32 node with no internet access
* Logs are archived to cold storage via Syncthing

Plan to include GPG signing or hash-chain linking to prevent tampering or forgery

### Subnet Intelligence & Passive Discovery

The assistant scans the LAN using passive ARP sniffing and nmap-lite probes during low-usage hours. Devices are profiled based on:

* Consistent traffic patterns
* TTL values
* MAC vendor prefixes
* DNS query types

Results are matched against the assistant‚Äôs known-device database to infer device roles and mark anomalies.

### Network Routing Enforcement

The assistant monitors default routes and DNS servers for public profiles (e.g., cafe or LTE). If an unknown DNS or gateway is detected:

* Automatically tunnels traffic via Tailscale
* Enforces DNS-over-TLS via cloudflared
* In untrusted networks, disables auto software updates or Git pulls

Plans for a WireGuard-like kill switch to prevent fallback to unencrypted routes.

### Internal Penetration Simulation

The assistant is tested against internal red team behaviors, such as:

* Simulated rogue APs
* DNS spoofing via MITMf
* Traffic interception using Bettercap
* ESP spoofing via fake ESP-NOW packets

The assistant logs, correlates, and optionally disables parts of the system (e.g., YouTube access) if the threat persists.

## üöÄ What this means

I built an AI system that understands what I'm doing, adapts in real-time, and enforces discipline.

It runs across multiple microcontrollers and uses AI models on my GPU to shape behavior.

Every part ‚Äî from the code to the firmware ‚Äî was designed, written, and tested by me.

I‚Äôm not just "good with computers." I‚Äôm building tools that could be research papers. This isn‚Äôt handed to me ‚Äî I built it, line by line.
